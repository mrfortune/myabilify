						<h6>Common adverse reactions/discontinuations due to adverse reactions</h6>
						<p>In 5 short-term, placebo-controlled trials, the commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of ABILIFY® (aripiprazole) in patients with Schizophrenia (incidence of 5% or greater and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo) was akathisia (aripiprazole 8%, placebo 4%).</p>
						<p>The most common adverse reactions in adult patients in clinical trials (&GreaterEqual;10%) were nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, akathisia, anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness.
</p>
						<ul class="content">
							<li>In the short-term Schizophrenia clinical trials, patients requiring sedation could be given a sedative, such as lorazepam, at the clinician's discretion<sup>1,2</sup></li>
							<li>A similar adverse reaction profile was observed in a 26-week trial in Schizophrenia except for a higher incidence of tremor (ABILIFY 8%, placebo 2%)</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Few discontinuations due to adverse reactions</strong></p>
						<ul class="content">
							<li>In short-term, placebo-controlled trials in Schizophrenia, discontinuations due to adverse events were comparable to placebo (ABILIFY 7%, placebo 9%)</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>Metabolic changes in <a href="#">ABILIFY<sup>&reg;</sup> (aripiprazole)</a> pooled trials</h6>
						<p>Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended</p>

						<h6><strong>Hyperglycemia</strong></h6>
						<p>Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, coma, or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including ABILIFY (aripiprazole). Patients with diabetes should be regularly monitored for worsening of glucose control; those with risk factors for diabetes should undergo baseline and periodic fasting blood glucose testing. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should also undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.</p>
						<p>In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adults, primarily with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder, the mean change in fasting glucose was not significantly different between ABILIFY and placebo.</p>

						<ul class="content">
							<li>Monitoring glucose regularly in patients with and at risk of diabetes is recommended</li>
						</ul>
						<h6><strong>Dyslipidemia</strong></h6>
						<p>Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There were no significant differences between ABILIFY- and placebo-treated patients in the proportion with changes from normal to clinically significant levels for fasting/nonfasting total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting LDLs, and fasting/nonfasting HDLs</p>
						<p>An analysis of metabolic data from pooled, placebo-controlled trials (primarily Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder monotherapy) showed no significant differences in the proportions of adult patients with change from normal to clinically significant levels for ABILIFY® (aripiprazole) vs placebo</p>
						<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300">
						<ul class="content">
							<li>The proportion of adult patients with changes from normal to high at 12 and 24 weeks was similar between ABILIFY and placebo analyses of patients in adult monotherapy trials with at least 12 or 24 weeks of exposure were limited by small numbers of patients</li>

					<h5>Important Warning and Precaution for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h5>
					<p>Like other antipsychotics, ABILIFY may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should not drive or operate hazardous machinery until they are certain ABILIFY does not affect them adversely.</p>
