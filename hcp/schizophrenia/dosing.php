						<h6>Dosing and Administration</h6>
						<img src="http://placehold.it/600x200">
						<ul class="content">
							<li>ABILIFY should be written for the smallest dose consistent with good patient management to reduce the risk of overdose</li>
							<li>The safety of ABILIFY doses above 30 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials</li>
							<li>Adjust dose gradually; increases should generally not be made before 2 weeks</li>
							<li>It is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain response; patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment</li>
						</ul>
						<h6 style="text-align:left;font-size:1.4em;"><strong>Dosage Adjustment Considerations</strong></h6>
						<ul class="content">
							<li>Strong CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, fluoxetine) inhibitors will increase ABILIFY drug concentrations; reduce ABILIFY dose by one-half when used concomitantly, except when used as adjunctive treatment with antidepressants in adults with MDD</li>
							<li>For co-administration of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer, reduce ABILIFY dose to one-quarter (25%) of usual dose</li>
							<li>In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, reduce ABILIFY dose to one-half (50%) of usual dose</li>
							<li>CYP3A4 inducers (eg, carbamazepine) will decrease ABILIFY drug concentrations; double ABILIFY dose when used concomitantly</li>
							<li>In general, no dosage adjustment for ABILIFY is required on the basis of a patientâ€™s age, gender, race, smoking status, hepatic function, or renal function</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Commonly observed adverse reactions for ABILIFY monotherapy</h5>
						<p>(Incidence &GreaterEqual;5% and at least twice the incidence of placebo for ABILIFY vs placebo, respectively): Adult patients with Schizophrenia: akathisia (8% vs 4%).</p>
