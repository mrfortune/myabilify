									<h2 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole to either valproate or lithium in bipolar mania patients partially nonresponsive to valproate/lithium monotherapy: a placebo-controlled study</h2>
									<h2><em>Am J Psychiatry</em>. 2008;165(10):1316-1325<br>Vieta E, T’joen C, McQuade RD, et al.</h2>
									<p>A multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-week study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral ABILIFY (15 mg/day or 30 mg/day) in adult outpatients with manic or mixed episodes of Bipolar I Disorder who experienced partial nonresponse to lithium or valproate monotherapy. Mean improvement from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale total score at week 6 (primary endpoint) was significantly greater with aripiprazole (–13.3) than with placebo (–10.7). Significant improvements in Young Mania Rating Scale total score with aripiprazole versus placebo occurred from week 1 onward. Adverse events occurring at an incidence of &GreaterEqual;10% for ABILIFY-treated patients and greater than placebo included akathisia (ABILIFY 18.6%, placebo 5.4%). There were no significant differences between treatments in weight change from baseline to week 6 (+0.55 kg and +0.23 kg for aripiprazole and placebo, respectively.<br><a href="#">Download full article (PDF)</a><br><a href="#">Download IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</a><br><a href="#">Download US FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION, including Boxed WARNINGS</a></p>

									<h2 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Efficacy of aripiprazole adjunctive to lithium or valproate in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder with an inadequate response to lithium or valproate monotherapy: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study</h2>
									<h2><em>Bipolar Disord</em>. 2011;13(2):133-144<br>Marcus R, Khan A, Rollin L, et al.</h2>
									<p>A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral ABILIFY (10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) in adults who were recently stabilized (YMRS and MADRS &le;12) on 12 weeks of ABILIFY + lithium or valproate. Patients were then randomized to either ABILIFY + lithium or valproate or placebo + lithium or valproate and observed for manic, mixed, or depressive relapse. Treatment with ABILIFY + lithium or valproate significantly delayed time to any relapse compared to placebo + lithium or valproate. The most common AEs &GreaterEqual; 5% (ABILIFY + lithium or valproate versus placebo + lithium or valproate ) were headache (13.2% versus 10.8%), weight increase (9.0% versus 6.6%), tremor (6.0% versus 2.4%), and insomnia (5.4% versus 9.6%).<br><a href="#">Download full article (PDF)</a><br><a href="#">Download IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</a><br><a href="#">Download US FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION, including Boxed WARNINGS</a></p>
