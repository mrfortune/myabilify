					<p class="boxed blue">ABILIFY<sup>&reg;</sup> (aripiprazole) is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder as an adjunct to lithium or valproate in adults.</p>
					<div style="width:80%;margin:0 auto;">
						<h6>Adverse reactions/discontinuations due to adverse reactions</h6>
						<img src="http://placehold.it/600x400">
						<ul class="content" style="margin-bottom:4em;">
							<li>A similar adverse reaction profile was observed in a 52-week adjunctive trial in Bipolar I Disorder for ABILIFY + lithium or valproate (n=167) vs placebo + lithium or valproate (n=166)<sup>1</sup></li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Discontinuations due to adverse reactions</strong></p>
						<ul class="content">
							<li>In an adult short-term Bipolar Mania adjunctive trial, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12% for patients treated with ABILIFY + lithium or valproate vs 6% for patients treated with adjunctive placebo
								<ul>
									<li>The most common adverse drug reactions associated with discontinuation in the adjunctive ABILIFY-treated patients compared to adjunctive placebo-treated patients were akathisia (5% and 1%, respectively) and tremor (2% and 1%, respectively)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul class="content">
							<li>In the 52-week maintenance adjunctive trial, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 11.3% for ABILIFY + lithium or valproate patients vs 8.9% with adjunctive placebo<sup>1</sup></li>
						</ul>
						<h6>Metabolic changes in <a href="#">ABILIFY</a> pooled trials</h6>
						<p><strong>APA Guidelines</strong><br>APA guidelines recognize the potential impact of antipsychotic treatment on weight.<sup>2</sup></p>
						<ul class="content">
							<li>Regular measurement of weight and body mass index (BMI) is recommended</li>
							<li>Baseline screening measures including personal and family history of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease are also recommended</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>Weight Gain</h6>
						<p>Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain.</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:2em;">Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.</p>
						<ul class="content">
							<li>Based on an analysis of 13 pooled placebo-controlled monotherapy trials (primarily Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder)</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="http://placehold.it/600x150">
						<h6>Dyslipidemia</h6>
						<p>Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There were no significant differences between ABILIFY- and placebo-treated patients in the proportion with changes from normal to clinically significant levels for fasting/nonfasting total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting LDLs, and fasting/nonfasting HDLs.</p>
						<p>An analysis of blood lipid parameters from pooled placebo-controlled trials (primarily Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder monotherapy) showed no significant differences in the proportions of adult patients with changes from Normal to clinically significant levels for ABILIFY vs placebo.</p>
						<img src="http://placehold.it/600x200">
						<ul class="content">
							<li>The proportion of adult patients with changes from Normal to High at 12 and 24 weeks were similar between ABILIFY and placebo. (Analyses of patients in adult monotherapy trials with at least 12 or 24 weeks of exposure were limited by small numbers of patients.)</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="http://placehold.it/600x200">
						<h6>Hyperglycemia</h6>
						<p>Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, coma, or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including ABILIFY. Patients with diabetes should be regularly monitored for worsening of glucose control; those with risk factors for diabetes should undergo baseline and periodic fasting blood glucose testing. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should also undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.</p>
						<p>In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adults, primarily with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder, the mean change in fasting glucose was not significantly different between ABILIFY and placebo.</p>
						<img src="http://placehold.it/600x200">
						<ul class="content">
							<li>Monitor glucose regularly in patients with and at risk for diabetes.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Important Warning and Precaution for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h5>
						<p>Like other antipsychotics, ABILIFY may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should not drive or operate hazardous machinery until they are certain ABILIFY does not affect them adversely.</p>
