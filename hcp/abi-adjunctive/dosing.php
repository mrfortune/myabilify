						<h6>Dosing for Adult Bipolar I Disorder, Manic or Mixed</h6>

						<ul class="content" style="margin-bottom:2em">
							<li>No dosage adjustments needed for lithium or valproate when adding ABILIFY</li>
							<li>May be taken with or without food</li>
							<li>ABILIFY should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management to reduce risk of overdose</li>
						</ul>
						<p style="font-size:1em"><strong>Dosage Adjustment Considerations</strong></p>
						<ul class="content" style="margin-bottom:3em">
							<li>Strong CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, fluoxetine) inhibitors will increase ABILIFY drug concentrations; reduce ABILIFY dose by one-half when used concomitantly, except when used as adjunctive treatment with antidepressants in adults with MDD</li>
							<li>For co-administration of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors or a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer, reduce ABILIFY dose to one-quarter (25%) of usual dose</li>
							<li>In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, reduce ABILIFY dose to one-half (50%) of usual dose</li>
							<li>CYP3A4 inducers (eg, carbamazepine) will decrease ABILIFY drug concentrations; double ABILIFY dose when used concomitantly</li>
							<li>In general, no dosage adjustment for ABILIFY is required on the basis of a patientâ€™s age, gender, race, smoking status, hepatic function, or renal function</li>

						<h5>Warning on Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs</h5>
						<p><strong>Children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders are at increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior. See Full Prescribing Information for complete Boxed WARNING.</strong></p>
						<h5>Commonly observed adverse reactions for ABILIFY as adjunct to lithium or valproate</h5>
						<p>(Incidence &GreaterEqual;5% and at least twice the incidence for ABILIFY + lithium or valproate vs placebo + lithium or valproate, respectively): Adult patients with manic or mixed Bipolar I Disorder (adjunct to lithium or valproate): akathisia (19% vs 5%), extrapyramidal disorder (5% vs 1%), and insomnia (8% vs 4%).</p>
