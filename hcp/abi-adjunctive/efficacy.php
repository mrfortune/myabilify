						<h5>Important Warning Regarding Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs</h5>
						<p>Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of adjunctive ABILIFY or another antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increased risk of suicidality in adults beyond age 24. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. ABILIFY is not approved for use in pediatric patients with depression.</p>

						<h6>Adding <a href="#">ABILIFY</a> significantly delayed the time to relapse<sup>2</sup></h6>
						<img src="http://placehold.it/784x500">
						<p>The number of observed manic episodes in the ABILIFY + lithium or valproate group were fewer than that in the placebo + lithium or valproate group (7 vs 19, respectively), while the number of depressive episodes was similar (14 vs 18, respectively).</p>
