									<h2><em>CNS Spectr.</em> 2009:14(4):197-206.<br>Berman RM, Fava M, Thase ME, et al.</h2>
									<p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjunctive ABILIFY compared to adjunctive placebo in adult patients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder who had an inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy (1 to 3 courses) in the current episode and an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective treatment with an antidepressant. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at endpoint (Week 6). The mean change in MADRS Total Score was significantly greater in patients on adjunctive ABILIFY compared to adjunctive placebo (<em>P</em>&lt;0.001) at endpoint. Adverse events (incidence &GreaterEqual;5% of patients in the adjunctive ABILIFY group and at least twice the rate of adjunctive placebo) included akathisia (18.2% for ABILIFY + ADT, 3.5% for placebo + ADT), restlessness (12.5% for ABILIFY + ADT, 3.5% for placebo + ADT), somnolence (5.7% for ABILIFY + ADT, 0.6% for placebo + ADT), and blurred vision (7.4% for ABILIFY + ADT, 1.7% for placebo + ADT).<br><a href="#">Download full article (PDF)</a><br><a href="#">Download IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</a><br><a href="#">Download US FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION, including Boxed WARNINGS</a></p>

									<h5>Important Warning Regarding Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs</h5>
									<p>Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of adjunctive ABILIFY or another antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increased risk of suicidality in adults beyond age 24. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. ABILIFY is not approved for use in pediatric patients with depression (<a href="#">Click here</a> for Boxed WARNINGS).</p>
