    				<p>*ABILIFY, when added to an antidepressant, following an inadequate response (defined as less than 50% improvement as perceived by the patient after a minimum of 6 weeks of antidepressant therapy at or above the minimal effective dose) to historical ADT (1 to 3 courses) in the current episode and an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective treatment with ADT, in adults with MDD, significantly improved depressive symptoms as early as 1 week in two out of three 6-week clinical studies and Week 2 in a registrational study, through study endpoint (6 weeks) as measured by the mean change in the Montgomery-&Aring;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score. Mean change in MADRS Total Score at Week 6: Berman 2007 - ABILIFY + ADT -8.8, placebo + ADT -5.8, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001; Marcus 2008 - ABILIFY + ADT -8.5, placebo + ADT -5.7, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001; Berman 2009 - ABILIFY + ADT -10.1, placebo + ADT -6.4, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001. <a href="#"><strong>Click here</strong></a> for additional study design.<sup>1-3</sup></p>
