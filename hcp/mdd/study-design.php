						<p class="boxed blue">ABILIFY<sup>&reg;</sup> (aripiprazole) is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in adults with Major Depressive Disorder who have had an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy.</p>
						<h6>A 3-phase study design to confirm antidepressant inadequate response<sup>1-3</sup></h6>
						<img src="src/img/mdd-study-design-1.png">
						<ul class="content eighty-percent" style="margin-top:-30px;width:755px;">
							<li>Primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in MADRS Total Score at 6 weeks</li>
							<li>Key secondary endpoint was the mean change in Total Sheehan Disability Score</li>
							<li>In these trials, the dosage range for adjunctive ABILIFY was 2-20 mg/day
								<ul>
									<li>ABILIFY started at 5mg/day with dose adjusted gradually based on response to maximum dose of 20 mg/day</li>
									<li>15 mg/day was the maximum ABILIFY dose for patients receiving adjunctive paroxetine controlled-release or fluoxetine</li>

						<h6>A large population of patients with MDD inadequately responding to antidepressant therapy<sup>1-3</sup></h6>

						<p class="eighty-percent" class="margin-bottom:3em;">*Similar baseline characteristics were observed in a third study, except for % female (ABILIFY 78.0%, placebo 68.0%); duration of current episode (ABILIFY 1.6 years, placebo 1.4 years); number of adequate trials in current episode (1: ABILIFY 71.8%, placebo 68.0%; 2: ABILIFY 21.5%, placebo 26.2%; 3: ABILIFY 5.1%, placebo 1.7%), ABILIFY + ADT (n=177), placebo + ADT (n=172).<sup>3</sup></p>
						<h5>Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h5>
						<p><strong>Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk (1.6 to 1.7 times) of death compared to placebo (4.5% vs 2.6%, respectively). Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be cardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.</strong></p>
						<h5>Important Warning and Precaution for Orthostatic Hypotension</h5>
						<p>ABILIFY maybe associated with orthostatic hypotension and should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose them to hypotension.</p>
