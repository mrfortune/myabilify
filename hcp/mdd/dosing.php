					<p><strong>Dosage Adjustment Considerations</strong></p>
					<ul class="content">
						<li>Strong CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, fluoxetine) inhibitors will increase ABILIFY drug concentrations; reduce ABILIFY dose by one-half when used concomitantly, except when used as adjunctive treatment with antidepressants in adults with MDD</li>
						<li>For co-administration of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer, reduce ABILIFY dose to one-quarter (25%) of usual dose</li>
						<li>In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, reduce ABILIFY dose to one-half (50%) of usual dose</li>
						<li>CYP3A4 inducers (eg, carbamazepine) will decrease ABILIFY drug concentrations; double ABILIFY dose when used concomitantly</li>
						<li>In general, no dosage adjustment for ABILIFY is required on the basis of a patient’s age, gender, race, smoking status, hepatic function, or renal function</li>

					<p>†ABILIFY, when added to an antidepressant, following an inadequate response (defined as less than 50% improvement as perceived by the patient after a minimum of 6 weeks of antidepressant therapy at or above the minimal effective dose) to historical ADT (1 to 3 courses) in the current episode and an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective treatment with ADT, in adults with MDD, significantly improved depressive symptoms as early as 1 week in two out of three 6-week clinical studies and Week 2 in a registrational study, through study endpoint (6 weeks) as measured by the mean change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score (<a href="#">Click here</a> for additional study design).</p>
