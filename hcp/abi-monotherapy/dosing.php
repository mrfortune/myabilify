						<h6>Dosing for Adult Bipolar I Disorder, Manic or Mixed</h6>
						<img src="http://placehold.it/600x200">
						<ul class="content" style="margin-bottom:3em;">
							<li>Adjust dose gradually</li>
							<li>ABILIFY should be written for the smallest dose consistent with good patient management to reduce the risk of overdose</li>
							<li>The safety of doses taken of ABILIFY above 30 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials</li>
							<li>The recommended dose for maintenance treatment, whether as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy, is the same dose needed to stabilize patients during acute treatment. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment</li>
						</ul>
						<h6 style="text-align:left;font-size:1.4em;"><strong>Dosage Adjustment Considerations</strong></h6>
						<ul class="content" style="margin-bottom:3em;">
							<li>Strong CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, fluoxetine) inhibitors will increase ABILIFY drug concentrations; reduce ABILIFY dose by one-half when used concomitantly, except when used as adjunctive treatment with antidepressants in adults with MDD</li>
							<li>For co-administration of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer, reduce ABILIFY dose to one-quarter (25%) of usual dose</li>
							<li>In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, reduce ABILIFY dose to one-half (50%) of usual dose</li>
							<li>CYP3A4 inducers (eg, carbamazepine) will decrease ABILIFY drug concentrations; double ABILIFY dose when used concomitantly</li>
							<li>In general, no dosage adjustment for ABILIFY is required on the basis of a patientâ€™s age, gender, race, smoking status, hepatic function, or renal function</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Commonly observed adverse reactions for ABILIFY monotherapy</h5>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5em;">(Incidence &GreaterEqual;5% and at least twice the incidence of placebo for ABILIFY vs placebo, respectively): Adult patients with manic or mixed Bipolar I Disorder: akathisia (13% vs 4%), sedation (8% vs 3%), tremor (6% vs 3%), restlessness (6% vs 3%), and extrapyramidal disorder (5% vs 2%).</p>
