					<p class="boxed blue">ABILIFY<sup>&reg;</sup> (aripiprazole) is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder as monotherapy in adults.</p>
					<div style="width:80%;margin:0 auto;">
						<h6>RESULTS: 3-week Bipolar Mania trial</h6>
						<img  src="http://placehold.it/784x500">
						<ul class="content" style="width:65%;margin:0 auto 4em;">
							<li>Starting dose 30 mg/day. Dose could be decreased to 15 mg/day for tolerability</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>STUDY DESIGN: <a href="#">ABILIFY</a> 3-week Bipolar Mania Trial</h6>
						<p class="eighty-percent">Adult patients with Bipolar I Disorder experiencing acute manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid cycling course, were tested in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 3-week trial (n=272). Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or ABILIFY with a starting dose of 30 mg/day that could be reduced to 15 mg/day for tolerability and subsequently increased to 30 mg/day for clinical response.</p>
						<p style="width:65%;margin:.5em auto;"><strong>The following symptoms of Bipolar Mania were measured by Y-MRS:</strong></p>
						<ul class="content" style="width:65%;margin:.5em auto;">
							<li>Irritability</li>
							<li>Disruptive or aggressive behavior</li>
							<li>Sleep</li>
							<li>Elevated mood</li>
							<li>Speech</li>
							<li>Increased motor activity/energy</li>
							<li>Sexual interest</li>
							<li>Language or thought disorder</li>
							<li>Thought content</li>
							<li>Appearance</li>
							<li>Insight</li>
						</ul>
						<p style="width:65%;margin:.5em auto 2em;"><em>Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) ranges from 0 to 60.</em></p>
						<h5 class="eighty-percent">Warning on Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs</h5>
						<p class="eighty-percent">Children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders are at increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior. See Full Prescribing Information for complete Boxed WARNING.</p>
						<h6>STUDY RESULTS: Monotherapy maintenance trial</h6>
						<img  src="http://placehold.it/784x500">
						<p style="width:65%;margin:1em auto;">The majority of relapses were due to manic rather than depressive symptoms. There are insufficient data to know whether ABILIFY is effective in delaying the time to occurrence of depression in patients with Bipolar I Disorder.</p>
						<h6>STUDY DESIGN: Monotherapy maintenance trial</h6>
						<p style="width:65%;margin:1em auto 2em;">Data from the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase (n=161) of a monotherapy maintenance trial in adult patients with recent acute manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder who were stabilized on ABILIFY 15 or 30 mg/day with a starting dose of 30 mg/day for 6 weeks and then randomized to either placebo or ABILIFY and observed for manic, mixed, or depressive relapse. Mean Y-MRS Total Scores at time of randomization: ABILIFY 2.6, placebo 2.1.</p>
						<h5 style="width:65%;margin:1em auto 0;">Contraindication</h5>
						<p style="width:65%;margin:0 auto 3em;">ABILIFY is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity reaction to ABILIFY. Reactions have ranged from pruritus/urticaria to anaphylaxis.</p>
