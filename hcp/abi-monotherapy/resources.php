									<p>A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 26-week study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral ABILIFY (15 mg/day or 30 mg/day) in adults who recently completed the 3-week study or were recently hospitalized for a manic or mixed episode associated with Bipolar I Disorder. Patients were stabilized (YMRS &le;10 and MADRS &le;13) on ABILIFY monotherapy for 6 consecutive weeks and then randomized to either aripiprazole or placebo and observed for manic, mixed, or depressive relapse. Treatment with ABILIFY significantly delayed time to manic relapse compared to placebo. Adverse events occurring at an incidence of &GreaterEqual;10% for ABILIFY-treated patients and greater than placebo included anxiety (ABILIFY 16.9%, placebo 14.5%) and nervousness (ABILIFY 10.4%, placebo 6%).<br><a href="#">Download full article (PDF)</a><br><a href="#">Download IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</a><br><a href="#">Download US FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION, including Boxed WARNINGS</a></p>

									<p>A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-week trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral ABILIFY (30 mg/day with the option to decrease to 15 mg/day) for the treatment of adults with Bipolar I Disorder with acute manic or mixed episodes. The primary endpoint was the Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) at Week 3. ABILIFY demonstrated statistically significantly greater improvement on Y-MRS Total Score compared to placebo (<em>P</em>&le;0.001) at endpoint. Adverse events occurring at an incidence of &GreaterEqual;10% for ABILIFY-treated patients and greater than placebo included headache (ABILIFY 25%, placebo 24.8%), nausea (ABILIFY 21.3%, placebo 15.8%), somnolence (ABILIFY 19.9%, placebo 10.5%), akathisia (ABILIFY 17.6%, placebo 4.5%), dyspepsia (ABILIFY 15.4%, placebo 6.8%), agitation (ABILIFY 14.7%, placebo 14.3%), constipation (ABILIFY 11.8%, placebo 5.3%), vomiting (ABILIFY 11%, placebo 7.5%), anxiety (ABILIFY 10.3%, placebo 8.3%), and extremity pain (ABILIFY 10.3%, placebo 5.3%).<br><a href="#">Download full article (PDF)</a><br><a href="#">Download IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</a><br><a href="#">Download US FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION, including Boxed WARNINGS</a></p>
